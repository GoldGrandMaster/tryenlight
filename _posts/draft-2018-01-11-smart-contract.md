Cryptocurrencies are the new topic of discussion. In this tutorial, we'll be building a decentralized application running on the [ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/) network. It will use [Solidity](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/), Ethereum's programming language for smart contracts. If you'd like to buy some Ethereum, Enlight has partnered with [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/59402dec9c87bc20803a5078) for users to receive $10 of free bitcoin for after buying or selling $100 worth of digital currency.

## What is a dApp, or decentralized application?

A dApp is a "blockchain enabled" website allowing a user to connect to the blockchain via smart contracts. dApps can use standard web technologies and are often meant to be used for financial and governance applications.

Here are the main advantages of a dApp:
- no hosting costs as they can be hosted using [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/)
- users don't need to sign up (credentials are public/private key)
- built in payment network (in this case, Ethereum)
- secure and "trustless" as source code is able to inspected

metamask

npm install -g truffle ethereumjs-testrpc
