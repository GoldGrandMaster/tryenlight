## Contribute by adding your projects & tutorials!
Enlight is open-source - which means we love contributors! Have a project on the web, a cool app you're making, or really  anything useful? Share your knowledge! It doesn't have to be a specific programming language -- just send us whatever you want to share!

If it's useful, it'll be posted on the site with of course, credit to you!

- fork the repo
- put the tutorial text in a `.md` file in the `_posts` directory and the source code in a folder in the `demo` directory
- submit a pull request

**or...** if you don't want to go through GitHub, you can email me your project+tutorial at techboss302@gmail.com

thank you!

## What is Enlight and why should I use it?
Enlight is a collection of articles and tutorials to enhance the process of learning to code. With topics spanning over many languages and technologies, Enlight is the home for everything development related. A couple years ago, I started to learn web development. At first, I ended up taking many courses and reading books learning. However, I learned so many terms, objects, statements, etc. that I couldn’t really implement them. Then, I started to make mini-projects by following tutorials online and scraping through code on GitHub. I believe that the best way to learn is to create. Make something cool. Then, with your newfound knowledge, make it even better. Trust me, you’ll amaze yourself.
